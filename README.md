## Template for hosting a webserver on a VPS

This is a template repo for hosting a webserver on a VPS. It's specifically set up to work with Digital Ocean, but most of it is general enough to be used with any VPS.

This is **not** a battle tested production setup, just a basic setup that I use for hosting some of my personal projects.
