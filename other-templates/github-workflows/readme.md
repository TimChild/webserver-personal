## Workflows here are basic templates

These are very basic templates (intended to copy and paste).

They are not set up as GitHub Actions workflow templates (that would be accessible via the GitHub Actions UI).

Consider just using the reusable workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory directly if you don't need to make changes to the templates yourself.
